# AI Strategy Assistant Implementation Plan

## Notes
- Architecture consists of Clarification AI Agent, Planner Agent, Dev Architect Agent, Client Persona Agent, and Graph Memory.
- Tools include: search_web, generate_prd.
- Follows modular agent design as per diagram.
- Use Streamlit for UI, LangGraph/LangChain for agent orchestration, OpenRouter for LLM API, Crawl4AI for web ingestion, and SQLite3 for storage.

## Task List
- [ ] Set up project structure with Streamlit, LangGraph, LangChain, OpenRouter, Crawl4AI, and SQLite3
- [ ] Define requirements and scope for each agent (Clarification, Planner, Dev Architect, Client Persona)
- [ ] Design agent interfaces and communication flows
- [ ] Implement Clarification AI Agent using LangChain/LangGraph
- [ ] Implement Planner Agent using LangChain/LangGraph
- [ ] Implement Dev Architect Agent using LangChain/LangGraph
- [ ] Implement Client Persona Agent using LangChain/LangGraph
- [ ] Integrate Tools (search_web, generate_prd) via LangChain or custom wrappers
- [ ] Implement Graph Memory module (using SQLite3)
- [ ] Implement Memory module (PRDs, Code, Web) using Crawl4AI and SQLite3/file storage
- [ ] Build Streamlit UI for user interaction and agent visualization
- [ ] Connect all components per diagram
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow (unit, integration, and UI tests)

## Current Goal
Define requirements and scope for each agent
