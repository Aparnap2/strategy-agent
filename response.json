      "clarified_requirements": "Here are 3 targeted questions to clarify your chatbot SaaS requirements:\n\n1. **Primary Use Case Focus**  \n   What core automation scenario connects Discord and HubSpot? (e.g., syncing chat data to CRM contacts, triggering marketing workflows from Discord interactions, or automating customer support tickets?)\n\n2. **Technical Boundaries**  \n   Are there specific HubSpot/Discord API limitations or compliance requirements (like GDPR) we must prioritize? Will this be a no-code solution for end users or require developer setup?\n\n3. **Success Measurement**  \n   Is the primary success metric user adoption (number of connected servers/accounts), automation efficiency (time saved per workflow), or revenue impact (leads generated via chatbot)?\n\n*Follow-up thought: Would you prioritize rapid MVP delivery or comprehensive feature depth for launch?*",
